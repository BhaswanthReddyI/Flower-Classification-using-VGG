## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an image classification model capable of predicting the species of flowers in the Oxford Flowers dataset. Using transfer learning with VGG16 for feature extraction, the model achieves high performance by leveraging pre-trained weights from a large-scale dataset. Data augmentation, regularization, and fine-tuning techniques were also employed to enhance the model's robustness.

## Dataset

- **Name**: [Oxford Flowers Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/)
- **Categories**: The dataset contains images from 102 different flower categories.
- **Structure**: The images are divided into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Format**: Images are organized by class and come with labeled annotations.

## Model Architecture

This project utilizes the pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction, followed by custom dense layers for classification. The VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, enables efficient feature extraction, while the dense layers adapt the model for classifying flower species.

**Key components:**
- **VGG16**: Used as a feature extractor by freezing its layers.
- **Custom Dense Layers**: Added on top of VGG16 for classification, tailored to the number of flower species in the dataset.
